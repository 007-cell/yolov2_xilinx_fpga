 Software Version For YOLOv2
 Considering that Vivado HLS C Simulation is very slow, I usually simulate the code in visual studio 2012 or vscode. From this code, you can also quantize the data precison from float-32 to fixed-16. 
 In addition, you can also change the hardware parameters to design different accelerators.
 
Two files about weight and bias are available [YOLOv2 Float-32 Weight & BIAS in BaiDu CloudDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pconJnUbu52KN4jd-1EgKg).

I have just completed the master's thesis test and will continue to update the entire project after June 5.
