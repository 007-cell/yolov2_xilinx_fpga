# Extract weight and bias from Darknet and combined with Batch Normalization
This reop is about how to extract YOLOv2's weight and bias from darknet. 

First, you should download the darknet source from [https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) and yolov2.weights from [https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov2-voc.weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov2-voc.weights).
