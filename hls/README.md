This repo is about YOLOv2 accelerator implemented in vivado HLS 2018.2. 

__Target Device:  xc7z020clg484-1__ 

__Target clock: 5.20__ (Estimated: 5.675 Uncertainty: 0.65; __I just ran it in 150MHz__) 

Current testbench can just pass C-simulation, tb for C-RTL cosimulation maybe need several days. 
Some other related files are available from software version foler.
